# Troubleshooting Guide: Error E-300 - Battery Fault

## Error Code
**E-300**: Critical Battery System Fault

## Symptom
The device has a solid red light, even when on the charging dock. It will not start a cleaning cycle.

**Additional Indicators:**
- Solid red LED (does not blink or change)
- Device is completely unresponsive to button presses
- Will not power on or start cleaning cycles
- Remains red even after extended time on charging dock
- Mobile app may show "Battery Error" or "Service Required"
- No charging animation or progress
- Device may feel unusually warm or cold to touch

## Root Cause
The device's internal battery has registered a critical fault. Potential causes include:
- **Battery Age**: Lithium-ion battery degradation (typically after 2-3 years)
- **Temperature Extremes**: Exposure to very hot (>140°F/60°C) or cold (<32°F/0°C) environments
- **Deep Discharge**: Battery depleted to 0% and left uncharged for extended period
- **Charging Circuit Failure**: Internal charging components malfunctioning
- **Cell Imbalance**: Individual battery cells not charging evenly
- **Physical Damage**: Impact or drop causing internal battery damage
- **Manufacturing Defect**: Rare cases of factory battery issues
- **Water Damage**: Moisture intrusion affecting battery connections

## Risk Assessment
**Safety Note**: A battery fault can potentially indicate:
- Swelling or expansion of battery cells (fire/rupture risk)
- Overheating during charging
- Chemical leakage (rare but serious)

**If the device shows any of these signs, advise immediate discontinuation of use:**
- Visible swelling or bulging of the device body
- Unusual chemical smell
- Device is hot to touch (>110°F/43°C)
- Any signs of smoke or melting

## Prerequisites to Check
Before troubleshooting:
- Verify the charging dock is plugged in and functional
- Check that the outlet has power (test with another device)
- Confirm the device is within the standard operating age (< 4 years)
- Note any recent incidents (drops, water exposure, extreme temperatures)

## Resolution Steps

### Step 1: Contact Cleaning and Inspection
1.  Ask the user to remove the device from the charging dock
2.  Ensure the charging contacts on both the dock and device are clean:
   - **Device contacts**: Located on the bottom, usually three metal strips
   - **Dock contacts**: Spring-loaded pins on the charging platform
3.  Cleaning procedure:
   - Use a clean, dry cloth to wipe both sets of contacts
   - For stubborn dirt: Lightly dampen cloth with isopropyl alcohol (70% or higher)
   - Ensure contacts are completely dry before reconnecting
   - Use compressed air to remove dust from dock contact pins
4.  Inspect for visible damage:
   - Corrosion (green/white buildup) on contacts
   - Bent or broken dock pins
   - Burns or discoloration around contacts

### Step 2: Proper Dock Seating
1.  Place the device back on the dock carefully:
   - Ensure proper alignment with the dock
   - Listen for a subtle "click" or connection sound
   - Verify the contacts are making firm contact
2.  Check the dock indicator:
   - Dock should have a light indicating power/charging
   - Some docks show green (ready) or blue (charging)
3.  Wait 2-3 minutes and observe:
   - Look for any change in the red light
   - Note if the device makes any sounds

### Step 3: Hard Reboot / System Reset
1.  Remove the device from the charging dock
2.  Locate the main power button (usually on top of the device)
3.  Perform a hard reboot:
   - Press and hold the power button for **15 seconds continuously**
   - Do not release even if lights change
   - Device may beep or vibrate after 10-12 seconds
   - Continue holding until 15 seconds complete
4.  Release the button and wait 10 seconds
5.  Place device back on charging dock
6.  Observe for 60 seconds:
   - Light should change from red to amber (charging) or green (charged)
   - If light remains red, proceed to Step 4

### Step 4: Cool Down / Temperature Normalization
If device feels warm or was recently used:
1.  Remove device from charging dock
2.  Place in a room-temperature environment (68-72°F / 20-22°C)
3.  Allow device to rest for 30-60 minutes
4.  Do not place in refrigerator or near heat sources
5.  After cool down, retry charging and hard reboot (Steps 2-3)

### Step 5: Alternative Charging Location
To rule out dock or outlet issues:
1.  Try a different electrical outlet in another room
2.  If available, test with a different charging dock (same model)
3.  Ensure outlet is not controlled by a light switch
4.  Avoid using power strips or extension cords (plug directly into wall)

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Battery Diagnostic Mode (If Available)
Some models have a diagnostic mode:
1.  With device off the dock, press and hold: Clean + Spot + Dock buttons simultaneously for 10 seconds
2.  Device will enter diagnostic mode (indicated by flashing lights)
3.  Observe the light pattern:
   - Red-red-red: Battery cell failure
   - Red-amber-amber: Charging circuit fault
   - Red-green-green: Temperature fault
4.  Note the pattern for support escalation

### Firmware Check
1.  If the mobile app is accessible:
   - Check if a firmware update is available
   - Some battery faults can be resolved by firmware updates
   - Attempt update only if device partially responds

## Warranty and Service Information

### Check Warranty Status
1.  Verify purchase date (typically 1-2 year warranty)
2.  Check warranty coverage for battery replacement
3.  Note: Battery degradation after 2+ years may not be covered

### Battery Replacement Options
If device is out of warranty:
- **Authorized Service**: $79-129 (includes labor)
- **DIY Replacement**: $49-79 (parts only, requires technical skill)
- **Extended Warranty**: May cover battery replacement if purchased

## Resolution Outcomes

### If Hard Reboot Successful
- Light changes from red to amber (charging) or green (ready)
- Device responds to power button
- Can initiate a test cleaning cycle
- Battery percentage shown in app

### If Hard Reboot Unsuccessful
1.  Inform the user that a critical battery fault has been detected
2.  Explain that the device requires professional service or battery replacement
3.  Advise them to contact customer support for:
   - Warranty verification
   - Service options and pricing
   - Authorized service center locations
   - Possible trade-in or upgrade programs

## Estimated Resolution Time
- Contact cleaning and reboot: 10-15 minutes
- With cool-down period: 45-75 minutes
- Service escalation: Varies (typically 3-7 business days for repair)

## Success Indicators
Issue is resolved when:
- Status light changes from solid red to amber or green
- Device charges normally (increasing percentage in app)
- Can power on and complete a cleaning cycle
- Battery holds charge for normal operation duration (60-90 minutes)

## Related Error Codes
- **E-301**: Battery temperature too high
- **E-302**: Battery temperature too low
- **E-303**: Charging circuit failure
- **E-304**: Battery not detected

## Prevention Tips
Educate the user on battery care:
- Keep device charged between 20-80% when not in regular use
- Avoid storage in extreme temperatures (garages, attics, outdoor sheds)
- Charge device at least once every 3 months if not in use
- Keep charging contacts clean (monthly wipe-down)
- Avoid deep discharges (running to 0% repeatedly)
- Use only the official charging dock (not third-party)

## Battery Lifespan Information
Set proper expectations:
- **Normal Lifespan**: 500-800 charge cycles (approximately 2-3 years)
- **Daily Use**: Battery replacement likely needed after 2 years
- **Weekly Use**: Battery may last 3-4 years
- **Signs of Age**: Reduced runtime, longer charging times, more frequent low battery warnings

## Customer Communication Tips
