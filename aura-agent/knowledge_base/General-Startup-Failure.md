# Troubleshooting Guide: General Startup Failure (No Lights)

## Issue Type
**General Power Failure**: Complete Device Unresponsiveness

## Symptom
The device shows no lights at all. It is completely unresponsive, both on and off the charging dock.

**Additional Indicators:**
- No LED lights of any color
- No sounds, beeps, or alerts
- No response to any button presses
- Device does not appear in the mobile app
- No vibration or motor activation
- Completely "dead" appearance
- No change when placed on charging dock
- Power button has no effect

## Root Cause
This usually indicates a complete lack of power reaching the device. Common causes include:
- **Depleted Battery**: Battery fully drained to 0%
- **Charging Dock Issues**: Dock not receiving power from outlet
- **Contact Problems**: Dirty or misaligned charging contacts
- **Deep Sleep Mode**: Device entered ultra-low power state (rare)
- **Circuit Breaker**: Outlet power interrupted
- **Power Supply Failure**: Dock power adapter malfunction
- **Internal Fuse**: Protective fuse blown (advanced hardware issue)
- **Catastrophic Hardware Failure**: Main board or power circuit damage

## Severity Classification
This is typically a **Tier 1** issue (power/charging related), but can escalate to **Tier 3** (hardware failure) if basic troubleshooting fails.

## Initial Assessment Questions
Ask the user to gather information:
1.  How long has the device been unresponsive?
2.  When was it last successfully used?
3.  Was the battery low during last use?
4.  Has the device been on the dock since last use?
5.  Any recent power outages or electrical issues?
6.  Any recent drops, impacts, or liquid exposure?
7.  Is this a new device or has it worked previously?

## Resolution Steps

### Step 1: Verify Dock Power Supply
First, confirm the charging dock has power:

**A. Check Dock Indicator Light**
1.  Ask the user to look at the charging dock itself
2.  Most docks have a small LED indicator:
   - **Green**: Dock is powered and ready
   - **Blue**: Dock is actively charging a device
   - **Off/No Light**: Dock has no power
3.  If the dock light is off, proceed to Step 1B

**B. Verify Wall Outlet**
1.  Confirm the dock power adapter is plugged firmly into the wall outlet
2.  Check if the outlet is controlled by a wall switch (turn switch on)
3.  Test the outlet with another device:
   - Plug in a lamp or phone charger
   - Verify the outlet provides power
4.  If outlet is dead:
   - Check the home's circuit breaker panel
   - Reset any tripped breakers
   - Try a different outlet in another room

**C. Inspect Power Adapter**
1.  Follow the cord from the dock to the power adapter (brick)
2.  Check for:
   - Indicator light on the adapter itself (if present)
   - Warm temperature (slight warmth is normal)
   - Damage to the cord or adapter housing
   - Loose connections at either end
3.  If available, try a compatible replacement adapter (same voltage/amperage)

### Step 2: Clean and Verify Charging Contacts
Even with dock power confirmed, dirty contacts prevent charging:

**A. Inspect Device Contacts**
1.  Remove the device from the dock
2.  Flip device over to access the bottom
3.  Locate the charging contacts (typically 3 metal strips or pads)
4.  Check for:
   - Dust, dirt, or debris buildup
   - Corrosion (green/white residue)
   - Oxidation (dark discoloration)
   - Physical damage or missing contacts

**B. Clean Device Contacts**
1.  Use a clean, dry microfiber cloth to wipe the contacts
2.  For stubborn buildup:
   - Dampen cloth with 70% or higher isopropyl alcohol
   - Gently scrub the contact surfaces
   - Allow to air dry for 2-3 minutes
3.  For corrosion:
   - Use a pencil eraser to gently rub away oxidation
   - Follow with alcohol wipe
   - Ensure all residue is removed

**C. Inspect and Clean Dock Contacts**
1.  Remove any device from the dock
2.  Locate the charging pins on the dock (usually spring-loaded)
3.  Check for:
   - Dirt or hair wrapped around pins
   - Bent or broken pins
   - Corrosion on pin surfaces
4.  Clean dock contacts:
   - Use compressed air to blow out debris
   - Wipe with alcohol-dampened cloth
   - Ensure pins move freely (press each pin gently)

### Step 3: Proper Device Placement
Correct alignment is critical for charging:

1.  Position the device on the dock carefully:
   - Align device contacts with dock pins
   - Lower device gently onto the dock
   - Listen for a subtle "click" or connection sound
2.  Verify proper seating:
   - Device should sit level and stable
   - No wobbling or tilting
   - Device cannot be easily nudged off alignment
3.  Observe the dock:
   - Dock light should change color (usually to blue)
   - Some docks emit a beep when device connects

### Step 4: Extended Charging for Depleted Battery
A completely dead battery needs time to accept charge:

1.  Leave the device on the verified working dock for **minimum 15 minutes**
2.  Explain to the user:
   - Deeply depleted batteries may not show immediate signs of life
   - First 10-15 minutes "wake up" the battery cells
   - No lights during this period is normal for extreme depletion
3.  After 15 minutes, check for:
   - Any LED activity (even brief flashes)
   - Warmth in the device (indicates charging activity)
   - Change in dock light color/pattern
4.  If no signs after 15 minutes, continue to 30 minutes total
5.  After 30 minutes, attempt to power on:
   - Press and hold power button for 5 seconds
   - Look for any response

### Step 5: Hard Reset / Force Reboot
Attempt to reset the device's internal power management:

**A. Standard Hard Reset**
1.  Remove device from charging dock
2.  Locate the main power button
3.  Press and hold for **20 seconds** (longer than normal)
4.  Do not release even if nothing appears to happen
5.  After 20 seconds, release and wait 10 seconds
6.  Place back on dock and observe for 2-3 minutes

**B. Factory Reset Button (If Available)**
Some models have a hidden reset button:
1.  Locate the reset pinhole (often near charging contacts or under a rubber plug)
2.  Using a paperclip or SIM tool:
   - Insert into the reset hole
   - Press and hold for 10 seconds
3.  Release and place device on dock
4.  Wait 5 minutes for initialization

### Step 6: Alternative Charging Attempts

**A. Different Outlet/Location**
1.  Move the entire dock setup to a different room
2.  Plug directly into a wall outlet (avoid power strips)
3.  Use an outlet known to work (where phone chargers work)
4.  Retry Steps 3-4 in the new location

**B. Different Dock (If Available)**
1.  If user has a second dock or can borrow one:
   - Test device on a known working dock
   - This isolates whether the issue is device or dock
2.  If device works on different dock:
   - Original dock is faulty (warranty replacement)

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Visual Inspection for Physical Damage
Guide the user to examine:
1.  **Device Body**: Cracks, dents, or deformities
2.  **Charging Contacts**: Missing or broken contact points
3.  **Water Damage**: Look for water damage indicators:
   - Small circular stickers that turn red/pink when wet
   - Usually located in charging port or under panels
4.  **Battery Compartment** (if accessible): Signs of swelling or leakage

### Listen for Internal Sounds
Sometimes subtle clues help:
1.  In a quiet room, hold device near ear
2.  Press power button and listen for:
   - Faint clicking (relay switches)
   - Brief buzzing (motor attempting to engage)
   - Any sound indicates partial power
3.  While on dock, listen for:
   - High-pitched whining (charging circuit)
   - Buzzing or humming (normal charging sounds)

### Temperature Check
1.  After 30 minutes on dock, carefully touch the device
2.  Device should be slightly warm (indicates charging)
3.  If device is:
   - Cold: No power is reaching the device
   - Hot: Potential short circuit (remove from dock immediately)
