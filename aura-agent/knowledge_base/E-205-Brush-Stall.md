# Troubleshooting Guide: Error E-205 - Main Brush Stall

## Error Code
**E-205**: Main Brush Motor Stall Detected

## Symptom
The device stops cleaning mid-cycle and emits a two-tone "uh-oh" sound. The app shows a "Main Brush Stuck" error.

**Additional Indicators:**
- Device comes to a complete stop during cleaning
- Two-tone audible alert: "Uh-oh" sound (low-high beep pattern)
- Status light flashes red three times, then solid amber
- Push notification sent to mobile app: "Main Brush Stuck"
- Device may attempt to reverse brush direction briefly before stopping
- Cleaning cycle is paused automatically

## Root Cause
The main cleaning brush is physically obstructed and cannot spin. Common causes include:
- **Most Common**: Tangled hair (human or pet)
- Carpet tassels or fringe wrapped around brush
- Small fabric items (socks, cloth, towels)
- String, yarn, or thread wound around brush axle
- Hard objects jammed in brush compartment (coins, small toys)
- Accumulated debris buildup on brush bearings
- Worn or damaged brush bearings
- Foreign objects in brush housing

## Frequency Pattern
This error typically occurs:
- In homes with long-haired residents or pets
- On high-pile carpets with loose fibers
- In rooms with area rugs that have fringe
- After 2-4 weeks without brush maintenance
- More frequently during heavy shedding seasons

## Safety Information
**Important**: Before performing any maintenance:
- Ensure the device is powered off
- Remove from charging dock
- Work on a flat, stable surface
- Keep small parts away from children and pets

## Resolution Steps

### Step 1: Initial Device Positioning
1.  Instruct the user to pause any cleaning cycle (if still running)
2.  Remove the device from its current location
3.  Place it upside down on a flat, clean surface (use a towel to protect both the device and surface)
4.  Ensure good lighting for visibility

### Step 2: Access the Main Brush
1.  Locate the brush guard (usually a yellow or green colored component)
2.  Guide them to unlatch the brush guard:
   - Most models: Press the release tabs on both sides simultaneously
   - Some models: Slide the latch lever toward the "unlock" symbol
3.  Lift the brush guard straight up and set aside

### Step 3: Remove and Inspect the Brush
1.  Tell them to lift out the main brush by grasping both ends
2.  Carefully pull straight up to remove from the housing
3.  Inspect the brush thoroughly for:
   - Hair wrapped around the bristles
   - Debris caught in the end caps
   - Tangled material on the brush axle
   - Damage to bristles or brush structure

### Step 4: Clean the Brush
1.  Use scissors or the included cleaning tool to carefully cut away tangled hair
   - **Caution**: Cut carefully to avoid damaging the bristles
   - Work from the center outward toward the ends
2.  Use fingers or tweezers to pull away loosened debris
3.  Clean both end bearings thoroughly:
   - Remove hair wound around the bearing posts
   - Wipe clean with a dry cloth
   - Ensure the bearings spin freely by hand
4.  Check that the square or hexagonal drive socket is clear of debris

### Step 5: Clean the Brush Housing
While the brush is removed:
1.  Inspect the brush compartment in the device
2.  Remove any debris, hair, or objects from the housing
3.  Check the motor drive shaft for obstructions
4.  Wipe clean with a dry cloth (do not use water in the motor area)

### Step 6: Reassemble and Test
1.  Align the main brush with the housing
   - **Important**: Ensure the square/hex end aligns with the motor drive
   - The colored end cap usually goes on a specific side (check user manual)
2.  Press the brush firmly down into place until it seats properly
3.  Replace the brush guard:
   - Align the guard over the brush compartment
   - Press down until you hear/feel the latches click
   - Verify the guard is secure by gently tugging
4.  Turn the device right-side up
5.  Place on the charging dock for 5 seconds, then remove
6.  Initiate a test cleaning cycle

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### If Error Persists After Cleaning

**Check for Mechanical Issues:**
1.  Remove the brush again and manually spin it while holding both ends
2.  It should rotate smoothly without resistance
3.  Listen for grinding or clicking sounds (indicates worn bearings)

**Verify Proper Installation:**
1.  Ensure the brush is fully seated in the housing
2.  Confirm the drive end is properly engaged with the motor shaft
3.  Check that the brush guard is completely latched

**Test Without Obstruction:**
1.  Run the device on a completely clear, hard floor for 1 minute
2.  If error occurs on bare floor, may indicate hardware failure

### Brush Replacement Criteria
Recommend brush replacement if:
- Bristles are worn down or flattened (less than 50% original length)
- End bearings are loose or damaged
- Brush has visible cracks or warping
- Error persists after thorough cleaning
- Brush is more than 12 months old with regular use

## Maintenance Schedule
To prevent future occurrences, advise:
- **Weekly**: Quick visual inspection and removal of visible hair
- **Bi-weekly**: Full brush removal and cleaning (for homes with pets)
- **Monthly**: Deep cleaning including bearings and housing
- **Every 6-12 months**: Consider brush replacement

## Estimated Resolution Time
- Basic cleaning: 5-10 minutes
